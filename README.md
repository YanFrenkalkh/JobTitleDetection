# Libraries Used
This project relies on the following Python libraries:

	1. pandas: This library provides data manipulation and analysis tools.
		It allows you to work with structured data, such as reading and writing data to/from various file formats, performing data filtering and aggregation, and handling missing data.

	2. numpy: This library is used for numerical computing in Python.
		It provides a powerful array object and a collection of functions for working with arrays, including mathematical operations, linear algebra, random number generation, and more.

	3. pycountry: This library provides ISO country-related information, such as country names, codes, and various geographical properties.
		It allows you to retrieve country information based on different criteria, such as country name or country code.

	4. pycountry_convert: This library extends the functionality of pycountry by adding additional features, such as converting between different country-related codes, retrieving country regions, and more.

	5. os: This library provides a way to interact with the operating system.
		It allows you to perform various operations, such as file and directory manipulation, environment variable access, and running system commands.

	6. warnings: This library is used to manage warning messages in your code.
		By using the `filterwarnings` function, you can ignore specific warning messages during the execution of your program.

	7. colorama: This library provides an easy way to add colored output to the terminal.
		It allows you to change the color of the text and background, making it useful for adding visual cues or highlighting specific information.

	8. matplotlib.pyplot: This library provides a comprehensive set of plotting functions.
		It is widely used for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.
		It offers a wide range of customization options for creating various types of plots.

	9. seaborn: This library is built on top of matplotlib and provides a high-level interface for creating statistical graphics.
		It offers a more aesthetically pleasing and concise syntax for creating complex visualizations, including heatmaps, scatter plots, and regression plots.

	10. plotly.express: This library is used for creating interactive visualizations.
		It offers a simplified API for generating interactive plots, such as scatter plots, line plots, bar plots, and more.
		The resulting plots can be embedded in web applications or displayed in Jupyter notebooks.

	11. scikit-learn: This library provides a wide range of machine learning algorithms and tools for data preprocessing, model evaluation, and model selection.
		In your project, it is used for tasks such as confusion matrix calculation, classification report generation, data scaling, label encoding, train-test splitting, and implementing various classifiers and clustering algorithms.
